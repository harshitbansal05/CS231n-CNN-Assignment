# CS231n-CNN-Assignment

These are my solutions for assignments of **Stanford CS-231n Computer Vision**. They are a part of my learning assignments for deep learning and machine learning.<br>
The assignment 1 is fully completed while assignment 2 is incomplete and under progress. In addition, it also contains a few ML notebooks developed while learning from **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron**.  Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
